# Overview

For this personal project, I decided to mimic the player rankings of the NBA2K games as best as I could, and also learn more about analyzing and interpreting data sets. This project allowed me to learn new technologies and expand my technical skill as a developer. I was able to learn more about data programming and using algorithms to handle data and deliver a desired output. 

The dataset being analyzed is NBA player statistics for the 2022-2023 season. The dataset contains various statistical metrics for NBA players, including points per game (PTS), three-point percentage (3P%), two-point percentage (2P%), games played (G), and minutes played per game (MP), among others.

The dataset allows for the analysis of player performance across different categories, providing insights into player contributions to their respective teams. By examining these statistics, one can evaluate players' scoring efficiency, playing time, and overall impact on the game.

The software I developed for analyzing NBA player statistics serves multiple purposes aimed at enhancing decision-making, performance evaluation, and statistical insights in the realm of basketball analytics. It also serves as an educational tool for students and enthusiasts interested in sports analytics, offering insights into data manipulation, statistical analysis techniques, and software development practices within the context of basketball analytics.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

{List the questions and the answers you found by doing this analysis.}
Below are the questions I answered using the Dataset:
1. According to the Dataset, who was the Most Valuable Player of the 2022-2023 NBA Regular Season?

    - The dataset indicated that Joel Embiid was the player with the highest MVP score rating, thus naming him the league's MVP for the 2022-2023 season. 

2. Who were the top 10 players of the league, and what would their NBA2K rating be? 

    - The top ten players were Joel Embiid (100), Luka Dončić (99), Jayson Tatum (99), Shai Alexander (98), Damian Lillard (95), Giannis Antetokounmpo (93), Donovan Mitchell (92), Anthony Edwards (90), Julius Randle (90) and Trae Young (90). The number in parentheses is the indicated player ranking. 

# Development Environment


To develop this project I used VS Code, Kaggle and the Python programming language. I also used Pandas, a library for handling datasets.

# Future Work

Things I hope to add in the future:

* Add proper encoding for special characters for foreign NBA players.
* Add a graphing function for easier visual comparison of the top players in the league.
